# Ludo-Game-Artificial-Intelligence

• AI Integration: Basic AI logic was implemented to simulate automated opponents making randomized decisions based on dice rolls.

• Turn & Collision Logic: The game includes working turn-based mechanics and collision detection that resets tokens when they're captured.

• Pygame Interface: A graphical interface was created using Pygame, supporting game board rendering, token animation, and menu screens.

• Object-Oriented Structure: Game logic was modularized using classes for players, tokens, and dice movement, improving maintainability.
